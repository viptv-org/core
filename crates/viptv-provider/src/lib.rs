//! Pure addon/provider client logic for the VIPTV backend server, which vendors
//! this crate with `scripts/sync-provider.sh`. The Crux core no longer depends
//! on it: the application-facing provider bridge was retired (BE-002).
//!
//! No networking or storage lives here: consumers fetch bytes and feed the
//! parsed JSON back in. Modules are feature-gated so each consumer pulls only
//! what it needs. `extras` and `candidate` are default; `discovery` is opt-in
//! and pulls in catalog planning, aggregation, and addon URL construction.
